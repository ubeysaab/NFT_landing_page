// Every partials should be imported to index file because is the one that's ultimately being compile and bringing every thing together 



// when we import partial file we don't have to add .scss extension the sass compiler is clever enough to figure that it self 

// ! The order of imports in file does matter
// 1. variables & functions : things gonna be usually over and over again

@use "variables";
@use "functions";

//2. base &layout stuff :  reset styles , top level styles  , grid system 
@use "reset";
@use "breakpoints";
@use "grid";

//3. colors : to generate classes like for backgrounds or text colors they're gonna use variables and maybe functions 
@use "colors";

// 4. Components : (button, card ,navbar,etc..)
@use "components/card";
@use "components/buttons";
@use "components/navbar";
@use "./components/homeSection";

//5. Utilities : (margin,padding,border,opacity) classes
@use "utilities";
